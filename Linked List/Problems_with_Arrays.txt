1) Either the size is fixed and preallocated (in both fixed size and variable sized arrays),
   and worse case insertion at the end is O(n)
2) Insertion in the middle(or beginning) is costly.
3) Deletion from the middle(or beginning) is costly.
4) Implementation of data structures like queue and dequeue is complex with arrays.


Qs which are hard to implement using arrays
1) How to implement Round Robin Scheduling ?
2) We have multiple sorted sequences and we need to merge then frequently.
