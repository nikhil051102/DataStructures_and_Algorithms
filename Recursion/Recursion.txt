Recursion : When function calls itself indirectly or directly.

Base Case : It is condition when the recursion stops.
          -> When the recursion stops, the function returns the value.
          -> writing return; is mandatory in the base case.

Compnonents of Recursion :
1. Base Case - If base case is not written then it will call segementation fault which means StackOverflow.
2. Recursive Relation - It is the relation between the base case and the function.
3. Processing

Types of Recursive Function : 
1) Tail Recursion : When the function calls itself at the end. Here Base Case -> Processing -> Recursive Relation.
2) Head Recursion : When the function calls itself at the 2nd. Here Base Case -> Recursive Relation -> Processing.
