Binary Heap -> It is complete Binary tree (all levels are filled completely except possibly the last level but Last level has to be filled from Left to Right)
            -> It is complete boinary tree because we can store it as an array without wasting any space.
We can store binary heap as an Array.
    1) Used in HeapSort
    2) Used to Implement Priority Queue

Height : If there are n nodes in Binary Heap then height of Binary Heap is O(logn).

-> There are Two Types
1) Min Heap : Highest Priority item is assigned lowest value
            -> Every root node has value smaller than its descendants.
            -> Root element is always minimum.
2) Max Heap : Highest Priority item is assigned Highest value
            -> Every root node has value larger than its descendants.
            -> Root element is always maximum.

-> Advantages
1) All items in binary tree can be stored in array without wasting any space.
2) Its complete binary tree thats why height of tree is minimum possible.
