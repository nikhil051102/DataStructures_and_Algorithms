Greedy algorithm is an approach of solving problems in most optimised way.

Application :
1) Activity Selection
2) Fractional Knapsack
3) Job Sequencing
4) Prim's Algorithm
5) Kruskal's Algorithm
6) Dijkstra's Algorithm
7) Huffman Coding

There are some algorithms which does not provide optimised solution but it is useful for NP hard problems like Travelling Salesman Problem.
