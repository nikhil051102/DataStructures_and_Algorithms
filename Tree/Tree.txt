Tree Data Structure : It is hierarchical data structure. It is recursive in nature.

Components of Tree :
1. Root Node : It is the starting point of the tree.
2. Leaf Node : It is the node which has no child.
3. Internal Node : Nodes which are not leaf nodes.
4. Child Node : It is the node which is connected to the parent node.
5. Parent Node : It is the node which is connected to the child node.
6. Sub-Tree : It is the part of the tree which is connected to the root node.
7. Descendant : It is the part of the tree which is connected to the leaf node.
8. Ancestor : It is the part of the tree which is connected to the internal node.
9. Degree : It is the number of child nodes of a node.

-> All the leaf nodes have the degree 0.


Applications of Tree :
1. To represent hierarchical data 
        a. Folder Structure
        b. Organization Structure
        c. XML/HTML Content (JSON Objects)
        d. In OOPs (Inheritance)
        e. In Database (Table Structure)
2. Binary Search Tree
3. Binary Heap
4. B and B+ Trees in DBMS
5. Spanning and Shortest Path tree in Computer Networks
6. Parse Tree, Expression Tree in Compilers.
