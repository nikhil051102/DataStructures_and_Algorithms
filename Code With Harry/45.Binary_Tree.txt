Binary Tree is the tree in which every node has degree less than or equal to 2.
--> Tree is made of Nodes and Edges.
--> If n nodes then there will be n-1 nodes.
--> Degree  of node: Number of Direct Children.
--> Degree of Tree : Highest degree of any node among the Tree.
--> Binary Tree is the tree of Degree <= 2.
--> Tree is Non-Linear structure which is Ideal for representing Hierarchical Data.



★ Types of Binary Trees:
1) Full or Strict Binary Stree : All nodes have 0 or 2 children.
2) Perfect Binary Tree : Internal Nodes have 2 children and All nodes are on same level.
3) Complete Binary Tree : All levels are filled except the last level and last level must have its keys as left as possible.
4) Degenrate Tree : Every Parent Node has only one child.
5) Skewed Tree : If Degenrate is left aligned then it is Left Skewed Tree and If on right then it is Right Skewed Tree.



★ Representation of Binary Tree:
1) Array Representation 
-> We don't call Linked Representation as Linked List Representation because list represents Linear Structure but Tree is not Linear.
