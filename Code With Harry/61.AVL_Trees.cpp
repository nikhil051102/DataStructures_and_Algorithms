// Introduction
/**
--> It is height balanced Binary Search Tree
--> Height difference between height of left and right subtrees for every node is less than or equal to 1.
--> Balance Factor = Height of right subtree - Height of left subtree.
--> |B.F| <= 1
--> To make AVL Tree balanced we perform rotations in it.
