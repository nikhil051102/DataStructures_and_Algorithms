Time Complexity: O(n^2)
If given array is alreadyn sorted, then the time complexity is O(n).
Space Complexity: O(1)
Stable Algorithm
Not Adaptive Algorithm but we can make it.


Steps to Implement Bubble Sort Algorithm:
1) Start from the first element and compare it with the next element.
2) If the first element is greater than the next element, swap the elements.
3) Continue the process until the last element is reached.
4) Repeat the process until the array is sorted.
