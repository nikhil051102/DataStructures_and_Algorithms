Time Complexity of Insertion Sort: O(n^2)
Space Complexity of Insertion Sort: O(1)

Steps to Implement Insertion Sort:
1. Start from the 1 index element of the array and compare it with the elements before it.
2. If the element before it is greater than the current element, swap them.
3. Repeat the above steps for the next element until we reach end of an array.
