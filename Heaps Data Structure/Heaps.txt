Heap is Binary Tree based data structure where it is not necessarily BST.

★ Heapify is the process of converting a given array into a heap.

★ MaxHeap
-> If the root node of tree is greater than the children nodes, then it is a maxHeap.

★ MinHeap
-> If the root node of tree is less than the children nodes, then it is a minHeap.

-> If there are n nodes present in Heap then its height is O(log n).


-> Important Properties
Node -> i
Parent(i) -> |i/2|
Left Child(i) -> 2i
Right Child(i) -> 2i+1
