Heap is Binary Tree based data structure where it is not necessarily BST.

★ Heapify is the process of converting a given array into a heap.

★ MaxHeap
-> If the root node of tree is greater than the children nodes, then it is a maxHeap.

★ MinHeap
-> If the root node of tree is less than the children nodes, then it is a minHeap.
